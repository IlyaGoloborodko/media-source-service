"""Logging setup: everything goes to the console, the important parts go to Telegram.

The code all over this project already writes plain `logger.warning(...)` /
`logger.exception(...)` lines. This module is the only place that decides where
those lines end up. Call `setup_logging()` once, when the service starts.

Two separate levels, both from `.env`:

    LOG_LEVEL=INFO           what you see in the console
    TELEGRAM_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR what gets sent to your phone

Telegram is meant for "something broke", not for a live feed — so by default it
only gets ERROR and above. Set it to WARNING if you want more.

Sending a message to Telegram takes a network round-trip. We never do that while
handling a request: log lines are dropped into a queue and a background thread
sends them. If Telegram is down, or slow, or the queue fills up, the service
keeps running and the messages are simply lost. Logging must never be the reason
something fails.
